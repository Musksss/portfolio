Developed an end-to-end personalized AI chatbot for a coffee shop using **PyTorch** and **NLTK**, incorporating a **feedforward neural network** and NLP techniques like **tokenization**, **stemming**, and **bag-of-words** to improve customer interactions. This chatbot was designed to handle queries about menu items, store locations, and promotions, providing real-time responses directly on the website. With an intent recognition accuracy of 85%, the system reduced query resolution time by 20%. In its first three months, the chatbot processed over 2,000 inquiries, reducing human intervention by 30% and boosting customer satisfaction by 25% based on follow-up surveys. As an end-to-end project, I managed everything from data collection and model training to deployment and ongoing optimization, enhancing both user experience and operational efficiency



### NYC Taxi Insights: Predictive Analytics for Tip Forecasting and Behavior Analysis
[Publication](https://github.com/Musksss/NYC-Taxi-Tip-Forecasting))

Directed the NYC Taxi Tip Prediction project, orchestrating comprehensive data analysis and predictive modeling endeavors. Employed **R** programming alongside libraries such as **ggplot2**, **caret**, and **mgcv** to delve into the intricacies of NYC taxi trip data. Segmented datasets using advanced data partitioning techniques and crafted visualizations to discern nuanced relationships between variables. Implemented a spectrum of predictive models, including **linear regression** and **logistic regression**, to forecast tip amounts and predict tip receipt probabilities based on factors like trip distance, time of day, and passenger count. Executed rigorous testing and evaluation, including **Root Mean Squared Error** (RMSE) calculations for regression models and **Receiver Operating Characteristic** (ROC) curve analysis for logistic regression, to validate the robustness of models on test datasets. This project underscores proficiency in statistical analysis, data visualization, and predictive modeling techniques across diverse domains.

### Data-Driven Tour Management Suite: R-Based Interactive Platform for The Weeknd's Global Concerts

Engaged in a project that brought together abilities to gather necessary datasets to support the operation of a twelve-month worldwide concert tour for The Weeknd. Converted the datasets into a functioning **relational database**, utilizing the data to run the tour and its peripheral businesses. Datasets were gathered to successfully organize and run the tour, including digital assets (images, videos) to enhance the app. Normalized (to 3NF), extracted, transformed, and loaded (**ETL**) the necessary pieces from the raw datasets to create a fully functioning relational database. Server space was provided to house the database. Built a Shiny app in R to showcase the results interactively and intuitively. The app connected to the database and contained all the SQL queries used to supply the data needed for the user to engage in the app. 

Users could view the dates and locations of each concert event during the tour. They had the opportunity to explore The Weeknd's musical assets, such as their discography, sample music videos, and lyrics to their popular songs, and buy merchandise. Users could plan a visit to the concert location city by having options for lodging, dining, and activities. Each user was also entered into a raffle to win a private concert ticket.

The project demonstrates proficiency in **SQL** (PostgresQL), **relational database management**, and **R programming** through the development of a Shiny web app for The Weeknd's world tour, integrating diverse datasets and providing interactive user engagement.
