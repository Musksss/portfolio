### The Weeknd World Tour: Dawn's Echo

Engaged in a project that brought together abilities to gather necessary datasets to support the operation of a twelve-month worldwide concert tour for The Weeknd. Converted the datasets into a functioning relational database, utilizing the data to run the tour and its peripheral businesses. Datasets were gathered to successfully organize and run the tour, including digital assets (images, videos) to enhance the app. Normalized (to 3NF), extracted, transformed, and loaded (**ETL**) the necessary pieces from the raw datasets to create a fully functioning relational database. Server space was provided to house the database. Built a Shiny app in R to showcase the results interactively and intuitively. The app connected to the database and contained all the SQL queries used to supply the data needed for the user to engage in the app. 

Users could view the dates and locations of each concert event during the tour. They had the opportunity to explore The Weeknd's musical assets, such as their discography, sample music videos, and lyrics to their popular songs, and buy merchandise. Users could plan a visit to the concert location city by having options for lodging, dining, and activities. Each user was also entered into a raffle to win a private concert ticket.

The project demonstrates proficiency in **SQL** (PostgresQL), **relational database management**, and **R programming** through the development of a Shiny web app for The Weeknd's world tour, integrating diverse datasets and providing interactive user engagement.
